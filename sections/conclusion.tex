% Problem
This work provides several contributions to the field of QoI-aware wireless networks.  
%In this work, we examined network capacity and design with explicit Quality of Information consideration from a practical standpoint.
% Solution
% method and results
First, we motivated the use of completeness and timeliness as QoI attributes, providing an example application and several different ways to measure completeness.  
%We support this motivation with results from running these image selection algorithms on a real data set.
Next, we developed a framework that can be used to predict QoI and network size limits for a specific network as well as predict expected probabilities of satisfying timeliness constraints beyond the point in which all queries are satisfied.  We validated these models' accuracy by comparing analytical results with simulations performed in the ns3 network simulator in both cases.
% Take away : Lesson
Examples of the impact of different network parameters were shown, providing concrete examples of the framework's usefulness in real-world applications.  In addition, the concept of scalably feasible QoI regions was introduced.
% Future work
For future work, we plan to make generalizations of factors that will allow for easy application of this framework to any non-regular network topology and expand this framework to include consideration of more complex network control actions, such as caching and/or data compression or fusion, which are all of interest in QoI-aware networking.
